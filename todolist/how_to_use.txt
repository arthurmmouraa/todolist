--> Hey! How are you doing?
--> If you're here, that might means you need some help using my to-do-list! Dont worry, I'll help you!

1º - Run your server (local or not);
2º - On the "tasks.php" file, you might need to change some settings:
	$servername = 'yourserversname'; (if local, don't change it)
	$username = 'yourserverusername';
	$password = 'yourserverpassword';
	$dbname = 'todolistdb'; (don't change it, thats the database name I created);
3º - Import the database located on "database" folder to your server;
4º - Run it;
5º - Ready to use! Hope you have some fun! ;-)
